**Buzz numbers** - they are numbers that are either divisible by 7 or end with 7.
For example, the number 14 is a buzz number, since it is divisible by 7 without
a remainder; the number 17 ends with 7, so it is also a buzz number.
However, the number 75 is not a Buzz number, since it is neither divisible by
7 nor does it end with 7. The number 7 is a Buzz number too.


A **Duck number** is a positive number that contains zeroes. For example, 3210,
8050896, 70709 are Duck numbers. Note that a number with a leading 0 is not a
Duck number. So, numbers like 035 or 0212 are not Duck numbers. Although,
01203 is a Duck, since it has a trailing 0.


A **Palindromic number** is symmetrical; in other words, it stays the same
regardless of whether we read it from left or right. For example, 17371 is
a palindromic number. 5 is also a palindromic number. 1234 is not. If read
it from right, it becomes 4321


**Gapful number** - it is a number that contains at least 3 digits and is divisible
by the concatenation of its first and last digit without a remainder. 12 is not
a Gapful number, as it has only two digits. 132 is a Gapful number,
as 132 % 12 == 0. Another good example of a Gapful number is 7881
as 7881 % 71 == 0.


A number is said to be **Spy number** if the sum of all digits is equal to
the product of all digits.


N is a **Sunny number** if N+1 is a **Perfect Square number**. In mathematics,
a square number or a perfect square is an integer that is the square of an
integer; in other words, it is the product of an integer with itself.
For example, 9 is a square number, since it equals 32 and can be written as 3Ã—3.


A number is a **Jumping number** if the adjacent digits inside the number
differ by 1. The difference between 9 and 0 is not considered as 1.
Single-digit numbers are considered Jumping numbers. For example, 78987,
and 4343456 are Jumping numbers, but 796 and 89098 are not.


In number theory, a **Happy number** is a number that reaches 1 after a
sequence during which the number is replaced by the sum of each digit squares.
For example, 13 is a happy number, as 12 + 32 = 10 which leads to 12 + 02 = 1.
On the other hand, 4 is not a happy number because the sequence starts
with 42 = 16, 12 + 62 = 37, and finally reaches 22 + 02 = 4. A number that is
not happy is called **Sad number**.
